## Future Improvements

**Idea:** 
1. Maintain Software Project Management exercise. 
2. Use Technical Reports to let students find information on how to presents there finding in a industrial standard. 
3. Divide the students in to permanent groups (max 7 members) and let each student be a leader for two weeks. 

**Implementation:**
 First each student does the task individually. Second they meet up and check each task. Third they select the best task for submission. When conflict occurs, in which to submit, the final say will be by the leader.
